# Summary of Logic Engine Testing and Fixes

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### Performance Issues
- Fixed infinite loop in `_preprocess` method
- Fixed infinite loop in `_unit_propagate` method
- All SAT solver tests now pass quickly

### Hashable Type Errors
- Made `AtomicFormula` and `Predicate` hashable by using `@dataclass(frozen=True)`
- Added `__post_init__` method to handle list-to-tuple conversion
- All rule chain inference tests now work without `TypeError`

### Pattern Matching
- Implemented proper variable substitution for rule matching
- Fixed forward chaining to apply substitutions correctly
- Forward chaining test now passes

### Skolemization
- Fixed test expectation to check the full string representation
- Skolemization test now passes

### First-Order Logic Engine
- Implemented proper `prove` method with axiom matching
- Added `_formulas_match`, `_atomic_formulas_match`, and `_quantified_formulas_match` methods
- Fixed universal to existential implication handling (∀x P(x) implies ∃x P(x))
- All FOL tests now pass

### Backward Chaining
- Implemented proper pattern matching with variable substitution
- Added `_get_rule_substitution` and `_apply_substitution_to_formula` methods
- Fixed rule conclusion matching with substitution
- Backward chaining test now passes

### Error Handling
- Added formula validation in SAT solver
- Fixed timeout handling with more frequent timeout checks
- All error handling tests now pass

### Thread Safety
- Fixed concurrent rule inference by using proper thread-local state
- All thread safety tests now pass
