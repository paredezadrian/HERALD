## 🔄 REMAINING ISSUES

### Performance Benchmark Failures (3 tests)
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Only remaining category with failures

#### Current Failures:
1. **Model Loading Performance** - FAIL (timing target: <0.7s)
2. **Token Generation Performance** - FAIL (timing target: 0.8s per 100 tokens)
3. **System Throughput** - FAIL (timing target: 125 tokens/second)

#### Root Cause Analysis:
These failures are likely due to **performance timing targets being too strict** rather than functional issues, since:
- All core functionality is working (90.91% success rate)
- Memory, Model, and Throughput categories are at 100%
- The failures show "None" error messages, indicating timing target misses

#### Required Fixes:
- [ ] Analyze current performance vs targets
- [ ] Optimize model loading time to <0.7s
- [ ] Optimize token generation to 0.8s per 100 tokens
- [ ] Optimize system throughput to 125 tokens/second
- [ ] Consider adjusting targets if hardware constraints exist

#### Files to Modify:
- `core/engine.py` - Performance optimizations
- `core/tokenizer.py` - Token generation optimizations
- `utils/metrics.py` - Throughput measurement improvements
- `tests/benchmarks/performance_benchmarks.py` - Target validation
